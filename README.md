I am a computer engineer and I have been working backend developer since last 20 years.

 

As you will see the in my Github account, I have developed simulation of flight screen of Sabiha Gökçen Airport.

 

I have used vue JS framework and I was using c# .Net core web service during the development process.

For 180 days of flight data, I created data by pulling daily data from the Sabiha Gökçen Airport flight information screen using the web service and writing an algorithm to randomly spread it over 180 days.

 

I uploaded this data to the MsSql database. I designed a data view screen using the vuejs/vue 3 framework to display the data I uploaded as an information screen.

 

On this screen, you will be able to filter 180-day flights and browse the pages with the pagination area.
